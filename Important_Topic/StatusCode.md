# HTTP Status Codes

- **Information responses (100 - 199)**
- **Successful responses (200 - 299)**
    - 200 OK
        
        The request succeeded. Everything is Fine.
        
    - 201 Created
        
        The request succeeded, and a new resource was created as a result. This is typically the response send after `POST` requests, or some `PUT` requests.
        
    - 202 Accepted
        
        The request has been received but not yet acted upon. It is intended for cases where another process or server handles the request, or for bath processing (Ex.- Sending notifications through email).
        
    - 204 No Content
        
        There is no content to send for this request, but the headers may be useful.
        
- **Redirection messages (300 - 399)**
    - 301 Moved Permanently
        
        The URL of the requested resource has been changed permanently. The new URL is given in the response.
        
    - 302 Found
        
        This response code means that URL of requested resource has been changed temporarily.
        
- **Client error responses (400 - 499)**
    - 400 Bad Request
        
        The Server cannot or will not process the request due to something that is perceived to be client error. (Ex- invalid request, malformed request syntax.)
        
    - 401 Unauthorized
        
        This response means `unauthenticated` . That is, the client must authenticate itself to get response.
        
    - 403 Forbidden
        
        The client does not have access to the content. Unlike `401 Unauthorized` , the clientâ€™s identity is known to the server.
        
    - 404 Not Found
        
        The server cannot find the requested resource.
        
- **Server error responses (500 - 599)**
    - 500 Internal Server Error
        
        The server has encountered a situation it does not known how to handle.
        
    - 502 Bad Gateway
        
        This error response means that the server, while working as a gateway to get a response needed to handle the request, got an invalid response.
        
    - 503 Service Unavailable
        
        The server is not ready to handle the request due to maintenance or server overload.
