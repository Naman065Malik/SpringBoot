# Introduction

# What is Spring?

Spring is a comprehensive framework for building enterprise-level Java applications. It simplifies development by providing tools for dependency injection, aspect-oriented programming, transaction management, and web applications.

# What is Spring Boot?

Spring Boot provides a good platform for **Java developers** to develop a stand-alone and
production-grade spring application that you can just run. You can get started with
minimum configurations without the need for an entire Spring configuration setup.

Spring Boot works on top of Spring and helps us write code with minimal configuration by providing built-in support for Tomcat web server, Maven build tool, and Docker.

## Advantages

- Easy to understand and develop Spring application.
- Increase Productivity
- Reduces the development time

## Goals

- To avoid complex XML configuration in Spring
- to develop a production ready Spring application in an easier way
- To reduce the development time and run the application independently
- Offer an easier way of getting started with application.
